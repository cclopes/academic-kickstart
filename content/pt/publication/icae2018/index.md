abstract: "Two hailstorms that occurred in March 2017 and November 2017 were analyzed using weather radar measurements from FCTH, lightning occurrence from BrasilDAT and a hailpad network deployed during SOS-CHUVA Project in the Metropolitan Region of Campinas. The most intense case according to radar and hailpads occurred in 2017-11-15, but showed low electrical activity during its life cycle, while the 2017-03-14 case showed higher lightning rates with less intensified reflectivity cores. Two relationships could be determined: an increase in lightning rate before hailfall, compatible with severe storms observations, and an increase in lightning rate after hailfall. These findings should be further investigated with an improved storm tracking and radars with better resolution and strategy."
