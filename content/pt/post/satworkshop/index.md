Between July 8th and 19th 2019, I had the amazing opportunity to participate in the first Satellite Meteorology Summer Workshop hosted at [CIRA (Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere)](https://www.cira.colostate.edu/) in Fort Collins, Colorado (USA). Besides the unique experience of being in a beautiful Colorado city (twice as high as SÃ£o Paulo), I had access to a huge amount of knowledge related to satellite meteorology, from radiation principles to satellite data assimilation.

The radiation principles classes were more than just a recap, with the usage of a software called [HYDRA](https://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/cspp/npp_hydra2_v2.0.shtml) (*not related to Marvel Universe* :sweat_smile:). You can not only open most types of satellite imagery, but analyze them in a simple yet powerful interface. I really had fun (and a tough time trying to interpret the results).

Satellite constelations and products occupied a good portion of the workshop, with full days of GOES, JPSS, NASA missions and EUMETSAT! The applications are **infinite**, *just as the channels in a hyperspectral sensor* :dizzy_face:, but the most interesting for me were the VIIRS Day/Night band applications, with a great [presentation by Steve Miller](http://rammb.cira.colostate.edu/training/visit/links_and_tutorials/Miller_SatSummerWkshp_JPSS_DNB.pptx).

In a field trip to Boulder, I knew some great people behind [COMET](https://www.meted.ucar.edu/index.php) (*and got a friendly reminder that I need to keep translating the materials*) and [Unidata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/) with their amazing softwares! I left there really inspired to learn (and teach) new tools.

My favourite part of all this experience was to meet people from different countries with all kinds of backgrounds and a common goal: use satellite meteorology in their research. After these two weeks, at least for me, this goal will definitely be fulfilled.
