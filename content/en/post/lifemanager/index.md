I'm a big fan of productivity tools - almost addicted to it, I must say.

I've been using [OneNote](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onenote/) (moved from [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) because of their several limitations in the free plan) since my undergrad to organize my various notes on classes, seminars, and research. During grad school, greatly influenced by my husband's work and its necessity to use productivity tools, I started to test one of the tools they were using: [Trello](https://trello.com/). I really liked its style and how I could break my research on several topics and follow their progress separately. However, it was hard to synchronize "manually" what I wrote in OneNote with my Trello cards. That became almost impossible when I found out about and started a [bullet journal](https://bulletjournal.com/), first on paper (tweet below), then online with task managers (I tried [Any.do](https://www.any.do/) and [Microsoft To Do](https://todo.microsoft.com/)). I was basically ~~wasting~~ spending more time organizing my three different apps for productivity than executing anything, not being productive at all.

That was it. I needed a single tool where I could document, organize, and define tasks. Then I found about [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), a [free-for-students](https://www.notion.so/Notion-for-students-teachers-adc631df15ee4ab9a7a33dd50f4c16fe) "all-in-one workspace" that (theoretically) does all that and more! It was love at first sight.

I spent days (literally) moving everything from Trello ([build-in import](https://www.notion.so/Import-data-into-Notion-18c37b470e8941789548b68049af750b)), OneNote ([following this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/el1kva/a_workaround_to_move_from_onenote_to_notion/)) and To Do (basically redoing all the tasks), as well as figuring out how to properly organize it. When I really understood how Notion works (watching [Marie Poulin!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpzKoBl909Y1s8hS5QpSlamyGqzmMqzDZ)), I spent even more days modifying my layouts and creating a functional dashboard (shown in the cover), a compilation of everything in my PhD project, and even a database of Animal Crossing: New Horizons!

{{< figure src="phd.PNG" title="My PhD page with a compilation of topics related to my project, sources/notes related to the research, activities, and the schedule planned in the project." numbered="false" lightbox="true" >}}

{{< figure src="acnh.PNG" title="My Animal Crossing database with info about my island and several useful links." numbered="false" lightbox="true" >}}

As you can see in the [suggested templates](https://www.notion.so/Notion-Template-Gallery-181e961aeb5c4ee6915307c0dfd5156d), the possibilities are endless. I particularly like [databases](https://www.notion.so/Create-a-database-2529ab92d63b478f87d39c2289527444) and how I can use them to link my tasks to bigger projects (like topics in my PhD project or seminars that I took notes). Another thing is the embed feature, which allows embedding a full page, PDF, and even [widgets](https://indify.co/) to any page.

Unfortunately, Notion is not perfect. The [lack of API](https://www.notion.so/Does-Notion-have-an-API-I-can-use-4541b07a5caa46dba0026624646118c0) limits some of the usability - there's **no offline mode** or **integration with other software**. Its [reminder system](https://www.notion.so/Reminders-mentions-777c3d4b488c4e3696f2cc9940cceb2c#76f37acba4b1478f86fac388cc7aeaae) is also quite limited for a task manager. Nevertheless, I really believe it's worth it and I couldn't be happier with my organization now.

I recommend to get started with [Notion Help & Support](https://www.notion.so/Help-Support-e040febf70a94950b8620e6f00005004) and [Notion Mastery by Marie Poulin](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpzKoBl909Y1s8hS5QpSlamyGqzmMqzDZ). Additionally, [Notion Expert](https://www.notionexpert.com/) has some excellent resources about Notion.
