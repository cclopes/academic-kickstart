This thematic grant develops research in Aerosol Life Cycle (ALC), Cloud Life Cycle (CLC), and Cloud-Aerosol-Radiation-Precipitation Interactions (CAPI) in Amazonia by several fronts, including a new site assembled near the ATTO Tower called Campina, which I'm currently involved by mentoring one of the instruments installed on the site.

See more information about the grant at [FAPESP funding agency website](https://bv.fapesp.br/en/auxilios/98922/aerosol-and-clouds-life-cycles-in-amazonia-biogenic-emissions-biomass-burning-and-impacts-on-ecosy/).
