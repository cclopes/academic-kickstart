The [SOS-CHUVA](http://soschuva.cptec.inpe.br/soschuva/) project developed research in thunderstorm nowcasting in the Metropolitan Region of Campinas based on acquired knowledge during [CHUVA Project](http://chuvaproject.cptec.inpe.br/portal/noticia.ultimas.logic). I help to coordinate a hail detection network installed for the first time in the region. Download the [app](http://satelite.cptec.inpe.br/soschuvaapp/) to monitore thunderstorms in real-time with weather radars, satellite and lightning detection networks.
