The LabNuvens laboratory studies the physics of clouds and thunderstorms development through remote sensing (radar, satellite and lightning detection systems) and in-situ measurements of its microphysics properties, as well as numerical modelling. I'm a member of the laboratory since 2021, contributing in the research and development (including [tutorials](https://github.com/LabNuvens)!).

Find more info about the laboratory in [the website](http://labnuvens.iag.usp.br).
