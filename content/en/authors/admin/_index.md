My name is Camila da Cunha Lopes and I'm a PhD candidate at the University of SÃ£o Paulo. My research interests are thunderstorms formation and life cycle in Brazil, which includes cloud microphysics, electification and remote sensing of the atmosphere. Some specific topics I study are: storm tracking with weather radars, hailfall features with hailpad data, 3D wind retrieval using Dual and Multi-Doppler, etc.

For my research, I use R and Python programming languages, using several packages for data analysis and visualization, as well as packages developed for meteorological data such as [MetPy](https://unidata.github.io/MetPy/latest/index.html) and [Py-ART](https://arm-doe.github.io/pyart/). For example, the [soschuva_hail repository](https://github.com/cclopes/soschuva_hail) contains the scripts I developed for my Masters dissertation, using radar, lightning, hailpad, reanalysis and satellite data.
